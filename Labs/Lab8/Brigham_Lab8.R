#4. Here is the discrete-time logistic growth equation, used in many models of population abundance over time:
#n[t] = n[t-1] + ( r * n[t-1] * (K - n[t-1])/K )
#where n[t] is the abundance of the population at time t, n[t â€“ 1] is the abundance of the population in the 
#previous time step, r is the intrinsic growth rate of the population, and K is the environmental carrying
#capacity for the population. Suppose that right now is time 1 (i.e., the current time step is t = 1). 
#If n[1] = 2500, K = 10000, and r = 0.8, then what do you predict for the value of n[12]? 

#Write a for loop that answers this question and that also prints out the abundance of the population each time step.

#make variables
abundance <- rep(0,12)  #make a vector (of placeholder zeros) that has 12 spaces for values of pop size
abundance[1] <- 2500  #make the initial value of abundance our starting population size
carrying <- 10000  #carrying capacity
growthRate <- 0.8    #growth rate
TimeStep <- 12  #the final time step that we're interested in

#construct a for loop
#need to start the for loop at 2 because t = 1 is our starting time,
#so n[t-1] must not be n[0], it must be n[1]. 
for (t in 2:TimeStep) {
  abundance[t] <- abundance[t - 1] + (growthRate * abundance[t - 1] * (carrying - abundance[t - 1])/carrying )
  print(abundance[t])
}

#the population size at the 12th time step
#abundance[12] = 9999.985


#7. Redo question 4 from part I above, but now store all the data.
#Make two vectors, one called "time" that stores the time steps (1 to 12),
#and one called "abundance" that stores the data on population abundances predicted 
#from the discrete-time logistic equation. Then, make a plot of the results (i.e., plot(time, abundance))

#make a vector to store the time steps we're interested in
time <- 1:12
#I already made a vector that stores the data on population abundances of question 4 that I called abundance

#make a plot of abundance over time
plot(time, abundance)
